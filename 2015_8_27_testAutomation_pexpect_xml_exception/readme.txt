This  version , i begin my first case of sanity testing.

This test is about checking whether the CBM is configed corretly.

Here's the progress:(multiThread,ssh,log)
1.check the CBM configuration
2.Check the Server's file with command (ls -l) to figure out the lastest billing
3.A call comes to Core
3.Then the CBM will get a log and this log will be send to the server, if the configuration is correct
4.Check whether the file is sent

The basic function is finish , then i will optimize the program
